# Sonic the Fighters - Decompilation
This repository will contain buildable code using GCC-esque tools to compile the executable binaries necessary to run the data of Sonic the Fighters on a Model2b arcade board. It is an accumilation of many years of work to better understand the inner workings of AM2's arcade engine from the early to mid 1990's.

## Compiling the program roms (wip)

- Instructions to compile the DSP coprocessor binary will go here.
- Instructions to compile the game's code while integrating the DSP program will go here.
- Instructions to compile the game's sound binary here.

## Assets

No assets for the game will be provided in this repository, however you will be able to extract them all using the various scripts and binaries in this repo.
- Instructions on extracting and repackaging assets will go here

## What this decompilation is:

This decompilation is an analysis of a game and all it's components. These components have been stripped down to human readable code to define the logic of the game in a way that can be rebuilt into it's original form.

## What this decompilation _is not_:

This decompilation is not open source. Just like it's predecessor, [stfdisasm](https://github.com/biggestsonicfan/stfdisasm), it is source available. This code is not licensed, and as such, all rights are reserved. GitHub's terms of service [allow users to view and fork the repository within the GitHub site](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository#choosing-the-right-license), and this allows for pull requests. The code may become licensed someday, but for now it will remain source available for research purposes.
